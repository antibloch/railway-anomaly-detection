# Railway Anomaly Detection

This repositiory contains the code to reproduce the results from the master's thesis on **Using Patches for Self-Supervised 
Obstacle Detection on Railways** by Matthias Brucker.

Datasets and models can be downloaded here: 

In order to **re-generate the datasets**, have a look at the dataset_generation directory.

In order to **train or evaluate** any of our patch-wise classification / semantic difference models, have a look at the patch_classification directory.
